# Bednar BatWing
When I first saw that the Bednar MM 7000 was being included in the game, I started planning this machine. One of my favorite mods that I spent time on in FS22 but never released was my edit of the John Deere HX20 by Black Sheep Modding - which had most of the same features as this mower. Now that the Bednar is part of base game, I'm hoping that Giants will allow me to release my re-write of the existing machine.

From a modding persective - I've re-structured the entire model, making the "wings" more flexible to contour to the ground better. I've added _mowing_ functionality to the machine (which was previously a mulcher), as well as _stump cutting_. 

In regards to stump cutting - my biggest gripe with base-game stump cutters is that most are either "point" devices (with almost no working area) or they include  cultivating / plowing / field creating functionality, which isn't always needed or desired. The **BatWing** has work-mode options for "brush hog" (mowing + stump cutting), stump grinding (without damaging the ground), or even "destroyer" mode (mulching + stump cutting).
